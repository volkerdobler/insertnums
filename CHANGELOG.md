# Change Log

All notable changes to this extension (newest first):

# Version 1.1.2 (not released yes)

- Optimized configuration options (using method `.get` instead of direct access)

- Fixed issue where configuration option `centerString` was not used
- Fixed issue where delimiter was not used for some sequences

# Version 1.1.1

- Added configuration option (`insertseq.sortedOutput`) to enable default insertion in sorted order (default: false) — can be changed with the `$` option.
- Added configuration option (`insertseq.reversedOutput`) to enable default insertion in reversed order (default: false) — can be changed with the `!` option.

- Deprecated configuration option (`insertseq.sortOrder`): still works, but might be deleted in future versions. As "reverse" always implies "sorted" output, this option was not ideal. The two separate new options should be used.

- Fixed issue https://github.com/volkerdobler/insertseq/issues/31 — the `sortOrder` configuration was not being used.

# Version 1.1.0

- Added **Quoted Template** mode: start input with `"` or `'` to embed a sequence inside a fixed text. `{}` is the placeholder; the sequence definition follows the closing quote. Use `\{}` for a literal `{}`.
- Added **Backtick Template** mode: start input with `` ` `` to embed sequences directly inside `{…}` blocks within the template text. Multiple `{…}` blocks per template are supported — each block has its own independent sequence definition. Use `\{` / `\}` for literal braces.
- Added **`\t` escape**: typing `\t` anywhere in the input (sequence values, template text, own lists, etc.) inserts a real tab character. The preview visualizes tabs using the editor's configured tab width.
- Added a small "What's New" notification for major and minor updates; it can be dismissed for the current version.

- Fixed missing output formatting within expressions.

# Version 1.0.8

- Fixed an issue with date option handling.
- Fixed a minor bug when the original sequence is used.
- Fixed a minor bug with the debug-mode switch.

- Updated packages to the latest versions.

# Version 1.0.7

- Added a configuration option (`insertseq.previewStatus`) to enable or disable the live sequence preview (default: true)
- Improved identifier parsing: ignore content inside parentheses, double quotes, and single quotes when identifying options
- Added `EXAMPLES.md` with live GIF examples

- Fixed a bug in `replaceableValues` so start and step values in the input are respected if reasonable
- Fixed a bug in `checkStopExpression`
- Fixed regular-expression bugs
- Fixed a bug with leading characters in decimals
- Refactored `extension.ts`
- Updated the `vscode` engine in `package.json` to `1.106.0`

# Version 1.0.6

- Quickfix: disable default debug mode

# Version 1.0.5

- Added support for user-defined (predefined) functions (via config files) using the start char "=" or "func[tion]:" — similar to expressions but can be predefined and reused.
- Added readable starter names in addition to start chars (for example: "predef[ined]seq[uence]:", "own[seq[uence]]:", "date:", "expr[ession]:", "alpha[bet]:"). Remember the trailing colon when using the long names.

- Fixed a bug in the evaluation function. If you use the expression option, consider placing it at the end of your input — some symbols can conflict with other start chars or options (for example, `*` is used for both frequency and multiplication in expressions).

# Version 1.0.4

- Web version is now working
- New configuration option "debug" for internal use

# Version 1.0.3

- Fixed regular expression to run in Linux environments/containers

# Version 1.0.2

- Removed web version as it did not work (hopefully temporarily until the problem is found)

# Version 1.0.1

- Added activationEvents in package.json for the web version

# Version 1.0.0

This is a brand-new version, completely rewritten from scratch with a major version bump.

The most important changes are:

1. You now see the current sequence as a live preview/decoration before pressing Enter.
2. The order of the insertion options is no longer fixed — you can provide the options in any order.
3. In addition to the short delimiter characters used previously, you can now use readable option keywords (for example: `steps:`, `freq:`, `repeat:`, `startover:`, `expr:`, `stopif:`, `format:`).
4. You can define predefined lists in your configuration file and use them from any starting point in the list.
5. If you only need a special list once or twice, you can provide a list inline for a single insertion (thanks to the history command, you can reuse it multiple times).
6. Several additional configuration options were added (see README.md for a complete list).

Most other commands did not change. 😎

What is missing / no longer available in this version:

- There is no special insertion mode for months anymore (previously starting with `%`). You can define your own sequences and lists (including months), but using date sequences is recommended for calendar data.
- The old "bash-like" history command is gone — use the new `insertseq.history` command, which shows recent insertions and allows editing.

### Commands are described in detail in README.md

---

## Previous version history

- 0.10.2
    - Changed: Number of leading characters is now consistent, even when starting with negative numbers and later inserting positive numbers.

- 0.10.1
    - New: "underline" is a new option for leading characters.
    - Changed: Leading characters can appear before any optional negative sign. After the negative sign, numbers are treated numerically; before it, the leading characters fill the block. Negative numbers are handled in a block-oriented way.
    - Fixed: Leading characters were required when the starting number was negative.

- 0.10.0
    - New: Added new formatting — you can now format with leading zeros, blanks, or dots.
    - New: Added support for date expressions (see README; still in alpha, without expr and stop-expression).
    - New: Two additional configuration variables: `insertseq.dateStepUnit` and `insertseq.dateFormat`.
        - `dateStepUnit` defines the default unit (day, week, month, or year) for one iteration (default: day).
        - `dateFormat` defines the default output format (default: `dd.MM.yyyy`). Validation of the output format is not enforced, so if you change it, ensure you use a valid format string.
    - Update: Visible command renamed to "Insert Sequence" (previously "Insert Numbers").
    - Update: Removed the old history insertnums command from package.json.

- 0.9.7
    - Last-minute fix.

- 0.9.6
    - (no notes)

- 0.9.5
    - Update: New placeholder text.
    - Fixed: Spelling corrections in package.json — thanks to @JessePeden.

- 0.9.4
    - Last-minute fix.

- 0.9.3
    - New: Added the ability to add months using numbers (integers from 1 to 12).
    - New: Configuration `insertseq.insertOrder`:
        - `cursor` will insert the sequence in the click order.
        - `sorted` will always insert the sequence from the topmost selection down.
    - Fixed: Minor bugs and stability issues.
    - Fixed: Some typos in README.md and CHANGELOG.md.

- 0.9.2
    - New (experimental): Starting with a semicolon, the sequencer assumes a month and will increment month names. You can format the output with `~l` to get long month names.
    - Additional configurations:
        - `insertseq.editHistory`: default `false` — if true, history commands are editable before running.
        - `insertseq.language`: default `de` — language for month name output (can be changed with `[lang]` after a month name).
        - `insertseq.languageFormat`: default `s` (short version — only the first letters of the month).
    - Fixed: Bug in the syntax definition of random numbers.

- 0.9.1
    - Fixed: Last-minute bug from 0.9.0.

- 0.9.0
    - New: Command renamed to `insertseq` because the command handles full sequences (numbers, letters, expressions, etc.), not just numbers.
    - New: Read configuration for default values:
        - `insertseq.start` : default start value (`"1"`)
        - `insertseq.step` : default step (`"1"`)
        - `insertseq.cast` : default cast (`"s"`)
        - `insertseq.centerString` : default centering (`l` for left)
    - Bugfix: Random numbers no longer always start at `<start>` — fixed to start randomly.
    - Bugfix: Expression mode issues fixed to match the original ideas from James Brooks.

- 0.6.4
    - Bugfix: The command did not start.

- 0.6.2
    - Bugfix: Step did not work with decimal numbers — fixed.
    - Update: Minor changes in the README file, especially documentation for formatting.

- 0.6.1
    - Bugfix: showHistory command in package.json was incorrect.

- 0.6.0
    - New command: `insertnums.showPickHistory` (default keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+,)
    - The command shows the history of previously typed commands (stored in global state). With the new option `insertnums.editHistory` (default: false) you can choose whether to edit the selected command before running it.

- 0.5.1
    - New feature: Output is by default based on selection order. Use `$` to force document order (top→bottom).

- 0.5.0
    - New features (all changes by Yu [@codingyu] — thanks):
        - History can be shown in an extra window (default: Ctrl+Alt+,). The history window lets you pick a previous command.
        - History is stored via globalState and persists between VS Code sessions.
        - New config `insertNums.historyLimit` to limit history entries (default: 30).
        - To clear history, you can still use `!c` in the normal input box (Ctrl+Alt\_.).

- 0.4.0
    - New features:
        - New implementation of a random sequence (see README.md).
        - New implementation of a bash-like history function (see README.md).
